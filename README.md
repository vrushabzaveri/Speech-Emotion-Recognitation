# **Speech-Emotion-Recognition**

### In this task , I created a machine learning model that can detect emotions from the speech and analyze it. The project is a classification problem, the model is trained using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and is reported to give accuracy above 99% with 0.003% losses.Accuracy can be increased by including more audio files for training.
